## Boilerplates

Electron-forge's build takes a really long time.

[electron-react-boilerplate](https://github.com/electron-react-boilerplate/electron-react-boilerplate) has a much, *much* faster build (order of magnitude) and has a bunch of stuff included I have to add in my EF apps.

IMO it's a bit more futzing around, but so far it's been worth it.
