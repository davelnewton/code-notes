# Visual Studio Code

Made the leap from Atom to VSCode; it's just better.

## Themes

### Material Theme

The "Darker" settings are a bit garish for me, and I haven't gotten around to toning
it down a bit, but it's roughly what I like.

### Material Icon Theme

Again, a bit garish, but overall, lovely.

## Fonts

### Fira Code

https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode

With ligatures enabled.

### Inconsolata

Google font; https://github.com/google/fonts

## Misc

### Zen Mode

`>Toggle Zen Mode`
`>Toggle Centered Layout`

## Plugins

### Code Runner

It... runs code.

### Bracket Pair Colorizer

We know our code shouldn't be deeply nested, but sometimes it is. This provides
ambient visual info to help spot blocks.

### File Utils

File ops

### Git

#### GitLens

Does a lot of handy Git stuff.

#### Git History

Log, file history, branch/version compares.

### Auto Fold

Folds files as their opened. Nice for files of any size.

### Rainbow Indent

I turned down the alpha to 0.6 (from 0.7). 0.5 is *too* faint.

### Turbo Console.log()

I don't actually use this because I need it to do something different than it does.

This is a marker to remind me to make a PR against it.

### Polacode

Take attractive pictures of your source code.

### Quokka

To be researched.
